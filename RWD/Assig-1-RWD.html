            Responsive web design (RWD) is an approach to web design that makes
            web pages render well on a variety of devices and window or screen
            sizes. Recent work also considers the viewer proximity as part of
            the viewing context as an extension for RWD.Content, design and
            performance are necessary across all devices to ensure usability and
            satisfaction. A site designed with RWD adapts the layout to the
            viewing environment by using fluid, proportion-based grids, flexible
            images, and CSS3 media queries,an extension of the @media rule, in
            the following ways: The fluid grid concept calls for page element
            sizing to be in relative units like percentages, rather than
            absolute units like pixels or points. Flexible images are also sized
            in relative units, so as to prevent them from displaying outside
            their containing element. Media queries allow the page to use
            different CSS style rules based on characteristics of the device the
            site is being displayed on, e.g. width of the rendering surface
            (browser window width or a physical display size). Responsive
            layouts automatically adjust and adapt to any device screen size,
            whether it is a desktop, a laptop, a tablet, or a mobile phone.
            Responsive web design has become more important as the amount of
            mobile traffic now[when?] accounts for more than half of total
            internet traffic. Therefore, Google announced Mobilegeddon in 2015,
            and started to boost the ratings of sites that are mobile friendly
            if the search was made from a mobile device. Responsive web design
            is an example of user interface plasticity. Responsive web design is
            a setup where the server always sends the same HTML code to all
            devices and CSS is used to alter the rendering of the page on the
            device. Google's algorithms should be able to automatically detect
            this setup if all Googlebot user agents are allowed to crawl the
            page and its assets (CSS, JavaScript, and images). Responsive web
